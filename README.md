This was just a small thing I made for myself and a friend to use so we could play both the uma musume Global and Japanese servers. It just renames the folder under %LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Cygames\Umamusume so you can have both versions installed and not have to rename them manually.
```
How to install:
  git clone https://github.com/JOPATE/UmaVer
  py setup.py'''

After that it should install the dependencies: burntToast and fzf if you dont already have those installed, and the shortcut should be added to the Start Menu.
If you find any bugs you can issue them, tho I rarely ever login to Github so idk when i'd fix it.
```


Also you must install both Umamusume versions before, not necessarily in game downloads...
You can install the Global version through Steam, as for the Japanese version you will need a VPN so you can download it through DMM.
